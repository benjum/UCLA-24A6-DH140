## Instructor:

Ben Winjum (bwinjum@oarc.ucla.edu)

## Office Hours: 

* Thursdays 10AM - 12PM and by appointment
    * [Schedule here](https://calendly.com/bwinjum/dh140)

## Course Description

This course is a hands-on exploration of coding in Python with a specific eye towards how it can be used in the humanities. In turn, we will also consider how humanities and a humanistic perspective can be used to inform the practice of coding. Coding is both a technical skill and an art form. It is a tool that can be used to explore and visualize many different types of data, analyze the flow of information and ideas, create novel forums and platforms for communication and expression, and produce products that can be used for tremendous benefit as well as tremendous harm. We will learn how to speak grammatically correct Python, how to use libraries of Python code, and how to use Python to tell stories of our own. In the midst of this process, we’ll look at examples that include (but are not limited to) identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks.

## Learning Outcomes

During this course, you will:

* Develop proficiency with the programming language Python and with the tools that support code development and practice
* Demonstrate the value of data for discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Gain expertise in coding and data science practice and research
* Apply Python to critically describe, analyze, and visualize data in the context of the humanities

## Course materials & technology

The course materials will consist primarily of Jupyter Notebooks and online readings. The only technology requirement on your part is access to a web browser.

**BruinLearn:**

All Zoom meeting links, grades, assignments, and discussions will be available through the BruinLearn course site, accessible at bruinlearn.ucla.edu.

**Jupyter Notebooks:**

* Assignments will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks. 
* All class notebooks will be accessible through the My CourseKata -> Jupyter Module on our BruinLearn course site. This module will allow you to access a JupyterHub that has Python and all required packages.
* You are, of course, also welcome to download notebooks to your own computer and install everything locally -- as a back-up, all in-class notebooks will also be stored on the web at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/benjum/UCLA-24A6-DH140).
  * Do note that you will still need to access and submit all assignment notebooks through BruinLearn via the JupyterHub instance linked in our My CourseKata -> Jupyter Module.

**Online Readings:** Each week there will be several readings of online content. These will provide context and stimulus for our coding activities.

### Discussion Posts

Each class session will have an assigned reading(s) that you should complete prior to the following class.  I will post a prompt or question on Canvas, and you will be required to submit a short discussion post in response to it on Canvas by 9:00am on the day of the next class (e.g., Wed. readings will require a post by 9:00am of the following Mon., and Mon. readings will require a post by 9:00am of the following Wed.).  The posts should be thoughtful and substantive but relatively brief, just a few sentences up to two paragraphs max in length. You’ll get full marks for completing a post that is on-topic. These posts are simply intended to get you thinking about the material. You are also strongly encouraged to read and respond to the posts of your peers, and we will discuss readings in the class after postings have been made.

### Assignments

Assignments will be the majority portion of your grade and consist of coding exercises, short answer questions that reflect on content, and preliminary work to get you moving smoothly towards your culminating final project.

They will be graded according to the following criteria:

* **Does it work?:** Unless you purposefully created code cells that produce errors to make a point, notebook assignments must run from top to bottom without any errors. Verify this by restarting the kernel and running all cells.
* **Does it work correctly?:** It’s possible to write code that runs ok but does not produce the intended results. The code should be bug-free.
* **Cleanliness:** Nobody wants to go through unreadable code! Make sure to document your work accordingly, providing markdown cells and comments throughout.
* **Thinking out of the box:** It is easy to copy an existing notebook and replace datasets and parameters to fulfill an assignment, but how well have you grasped the underlying concepts? This can be demonstrated by *applying* your skills in new ways rather than *copying* each step of a given assignment. For example, you may experiment with functions not demonstrated in class, or create your own workflow that borrows certain concepts learned in class to make them your own.

### Final Project

* The final project is a cumulative and applied assignment that requires you to collectively use the skills you’ve developed over the entire course. This project focuses on answering an interesting research question (or questions) using the data analysis and visualization methods you have learned.
* I will distribute a more-detailed explanation during the 2nd week.  The final product will consist of a Jupyter notebook containing code used to analyse a substantive and specific question on a humanities-related research topic, as well as an accompanying webpage report and a short (5-10 minute) presentation of your analysis.
* All necessary coding details will be covered over the course of our class.

## Late Work Policy

* Our time is very short, so I urge you to stay on top of assignments.
* If you can not submit something on time, please contact me before a due date and we can make alternative arrangements.
* If we do not make prior arrangements, I will give a one-day grace period on assignments, following which 5% will be deducted from your assignment grade for each subsequent day.
    * Ideally we should make alternative arrangements first before falling into this edge case.
* Final projects are due on the last day of the session, Friday August 2.
  * I will be less lenient with this deadline, but if external circumstances absolutely prevent you from completing the final project, we can discuss your situation in-person (via Zoom).

## How to ask a technical question

Given the nature of the course, you may have many, many questions along the way. However, please adhere to the following guidelines in order to make consultations as productive as possible. If you do not follow these guidelines, you may be asked to simply reconsider your question.

Before asking a question:

1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
1. Search google and stackoverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you’re struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
1. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
1. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven’t solved your problem, send an email (or attend office hours) and include the following information:

1. A detailed description of what you’re trying to do, why, and how
1. A complete [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code)
1. What you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from stackoverflow etc)

## Readings and Resources

Readings will be posted in the assignment sections for each week. The following are a list of resources to help you with Python and Jupyter as needed:

* [Think Python 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey
* [Learn Python the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) by Zed A. Shaw
* Jupyter Notebooks [Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Statement of Affirmation

I intend to make this classroom a space that affirms all identities and perspectives, including your race, color, national origin, ethnic origin, ancestry, marital status, religion, age, sex, gender, gender expression, gender identity, transgender status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information (including family medical history), sexual orientation, political ideology and affiliations, citizenship, or service in the uniformed services. Regardless of background, all students have a right to an equitable education. Because of the multi-faceted and complex nature of our identities, it is imperative that we are committed to affirming one another’s perspectives as a community for all enrolled in this course. I encourage all members to embrace and learn from the diversity in this classroom, school, and university. I want to highlight that discrimination, harassment, or forms of hateful transgressions will not be tolerated in our learning environment. If you have any recommendations about how to make our environment more inclusive please feel free to let me know.

## Academic Integrity

UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, we are all responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a member of the University community, you are expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. I encourage interaction while learning the material, but cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work on written assignments such that you are sharing answers, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and may result in formal disciplinary proceedings, which may result in suspension or dismissal.

**Don’t take chances.** Ask me if you are unclear about UCLA policy. Ignorance is NO defense. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead me to suspect you of cheating.

**Alternatives to dishonest behavior:**

* **Seek out help.** Talk with me to see if there is special tutoring or other arrangements to be made.
* **Drop the course.** Can you take it again in the future when you might feel more prepared or less pressured?
* **See a counselor.** UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.

You have worked very hard to get here, so don’t cheat! You don’t need to. If you would like more information, please see the Dean of Students’ Office in 1206 Murphy Hall, call (310) 825-3871, or visit their website at www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu.

## Student Resources for Support and Learning

**Providing feedback to me:** I encourage your feedback at any time throughout our summer session about things that are helping you learn, or things that aren’t helping. Please communicate with me if there are ways that we can improve the course.

**Personal problems:** Sometimes, factors out of our control make it difficult to focus on schoolwork. If you are having a personal problem that affects your participation, please talk to me so we can create a plan. If you are not comfortable speaking with me directly, please utilize the other student resources provided below in order to understand how to best approach success in this course given your personal needs. Please do not wait until the end of our summer session to share any challenges that have negatively impacted you. The sooner we meet, the more options we will have to support your overall academic success.

**Academic accomodations based on a disability:** If you are already registered with the Center for Accessible Education (CAE), please request your Letter of Accommodation on the Student Portal. If you are seeking registration with the CAE, please submit your request for accommodations via the CAE website. Please note that the CAE does not send accommodations letters to instructors–you must request that I view the letter in the online Faculty Portal. Once you have requested your accommodations via the Student Portal, please notify me immediately so I can view your letter. Students with disabilities requiring academic accommodations should submit their request for accommodations as soon as possible, as it may take up to two weeks to review the request. For more information, please visit the CAE website (www.cae.ucla.edu), visit the CAE at A255 Murphy Hall, or contact by phone at (310) 825-1501.
